# PROGRESS

Resume rule: read this file, then continue from the first phase not marked done.

## Phase 0 — Audit · DONE
- `docs/AUDIT.md` written. Baseline commit `a7631af` (repo initialised; `.env`, `vendor`, `node_modules`, `*.sqlite` are git-ignored).
- Key gaps: test suite does not run (duplicate Pest `uses()`), English validation/date/pagination text, three views duplicate the quote card, index migration pending on the local DB, 9 long rows in `quotes`.
- Phase 6 decision (owner, 2026-10-28): **keep the 9 long rows as legacy**, no schema/data change; show a notice on their edit form.
- Next: Phase 1.

## Phase 1 — Quotes display · DONE
- Test suite fixed (duplicate Pest `uses()`); 26/26 pass.
- Arabic locale (`lang/ar/validation.php`, `lang/ar/pagination.php`, `APP_LOCALE=ar`): dates now "منذ 3 أيام".
- New Arabic pagination view `resources/views/pagination/midad.blade.php` set as default in `AppServiceProvider`.
- "قراءة المزيد" shown only on clamped cards (`markClampedQuotes()` in `app.js`); assets rebuilt.
- Verified on local server: home renders exactly 5 cards; `/quotes?page=2` shows "عرض 13–24 من 29".
- Next: Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Functional requirements · DONE
- All 7 rules were already enforced server-side; gap was UX: password/login errors now render next to the field via `x-form-field`.
- Arabic length messages ("عدد أحرف الاسم يجب ألا يقل عن 2."); fixed CSS that turned `.field-error` grey outside the quote form.
- New `tests/Feature/FinalGuideTest.php` (8 tests); timed tests now use `forceCreate` (created_at is not fillable). 34/34 pass.
- Next: Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Non-functional · DONE
- Quote rules moved to `app/Http/Requests/QuoteRequest.php` (shared by store/update, trims text, category constant).
- `tests/Feature/PerformanceTest.php`: query count is constant with 3 vs 23 quotes on home and /quotes (no N+1); indexes asserted.
- Local DB: backed up to `database/database.backup-2026-10-28.sqlite` (git-ignored), then applied pending `quotes_latest_index` migration; 29 rows intact.
- Measured (local `php artisan serve`, 5 runs): /quotes median 0.237s, page 2 0.245s, search+filter 0.209s, home 0.223s.
- 36/36 tests pass. Next: Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Blade inheritance + components · DONE
- `Quote::scopeWithCardData()` holds the card's eager loading; used by home, /quotes, favorites, profile, author pages.
- Favorites, profile and author pages now render `<x-quote-card>` (was 3 hand-written copies).
- New `<x-quote-fields>` used by create, edit and the home composer dialog (was 3 copies); `<x-form-field>` gained a `name` prop.
- Legacy-length notice on the edit form for quotes > 155 chars (Phase 6 decision).
- Tests: shared card on all 5 listings, every page view `@extends('layouts.app')`, legacy notice. 39/39 pass.
- Next: Phase 5.

## Phase 5 — Extra feature · DONE
- Present: **Likes + Bookmarks (الإعجاب والحفظ)**, supported by search & category filter.
- Added `User::likes()/favorites()`, `QuoteLike::quote()/user()`, `QuoteFavorite::user()`.
- Bookmark toggle now uses the same locked transaction as likes (no 500 on double submit).
- Test: toggle, favorites page, DB unique constraint, cascade on quote delete. 40/40 pass.

## Phase 6 — Length conflict · DONE (owner chose "keep as legacy")
- Mu'allaqat (`config/muallaqat.php`) and classical poets (`config/featured_poets.php`) are separate from the DB.
- 9 long rows stay untouched in `quotes`; create/edit limited to 3–155 via `QuoteRequest`; edit form shows a legacy-length notice.
- Next: Phase 7 deliverables.

## Phase 7 — Deliverables · DONE
- `docs/SRS.md` rewritten for the final app → `deliverables/Abdulaziz_SRS.pdf` (rendered with headless Edge).
- `docs/ERD.mmd` annotated with unique keys/indexes → `deliverables/Abdulaziz_ERD.pdf` + `.png` + `.mmd`.
- `docs/DEMO-1-MIN.md` 60-second Arabic script → `deliverables/Abdulaziz_Demo_Script.md`.
- README run steps updated. `deliverables/Abdulaziz_SourceCode.zip` built with `git archive HEAD` (excludes vendor, node_modules, .env, *.sqlite, logs, public/build).
- Layout check (Edge headless): 10 pages × 390/1440px, no horizontal scroll; full load 0.31–0.60s.

# TASK 2 — UX polish, profile, ink welcome, auth, speed

## T2 Phase 1 — Speed · DONE
Root causes (measured with headless Edge, cache disabled, 1440px):
1. PHP OPcache disabled in XAMPP → every request recompiled Laravel. Enabled in `C:\xampp\php\php.ini` (backup `php.ini.backup-2026-10-28`; outside repo). TTFB 270–454ms → 17–44ms.
2. Hotlinked Wikimedia images (home 318KB, /muallaqat 2.6MB, 0.8–1.5s each) → self-hosted 720px WebP in `public/images/poets/` (425KB total); credits unchanged.
3. Unused axios in every bundle → removed `resources/js/bootstrap.js`. JS 66.5KB → 16.1KB.
4. Tailwind scanned Laravel's unused pagination views → removed `@source`. CSS 104.6KB → 92.1KB.
5. Saved dark theme applied only after JS → inline head script (no light flash).
Added: hover/touch/focus prefetch (10s TTL) in `loadPage`, copper progress line, POST double-submit guard.
Numbers: home load 819ms → 321ms; /quotes 446ms → 95ms; /muallaqat 464ms/3.35MB → 146ms/1.03MB.
In-site navigation (click → new page): 42–71ms; hover-then-click 11–16ms.
Fonts (470–630KB cold, cached after) not subset: Thmanyah licence for modified files not in repo.

## T2 Phase 2 — Opening message removed · DONE
- Welcome `<dialog>` (typed "السلام عليكم…" message) removed from `layouts/app.blade.php`, its JS (~70 lines) and ~40 CSS rules.
- Audio kept: navbar player folded into a compact «الأجواء» `<details>` menu (`site-header.blade.php`); closes on outside click/Escape; never autoplays (resume only after a user gesture).
- Test `UxPolishTest`: no welcome text on 3 pages, audio menu present, no `autoplay`. 41/41 pass.

## T2 Phase 3 — Ink welcome · DONE
- `components/ink-welcome.blade.php` in the hero: «أهلًا بك في مِـداد» (one kashida, kasra kept) / signed-in «أهلًا بك يا {name} في مِـداد» (escaped), original line «هنا يهدأُ الحبرُ على الورق، وتبقى الكلمةُ أثرًا لا يجفّ.» + inline SVG copper stroke.
- Font: Amiri Bold Arabic self-hosted (`public/fonts/amiri`, OFL licence included, 98KB, preloaded on home only).
- Animation ≈3.5s: RTL mask sweep + blur→sharp + slight drift; stroke draws right→left. Final state is the default; `.is-animating` added by inline script (full load) or `midad:page-loaded` (in-site nav), once per session (sessionStorage), skipped for reduced motion.
- Browser check: animates on first visit only, not on 2nd visit or in-site nav; reduced motion static; CLS 0.0024 (1440) / 0 (390); no overflow. 42/42 tests.

## T2 Phase 4 — Auth UX · DONE
- Root cause of failing reset: `.env` had `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` → 127.0.0.1:2525 (Laravel placeholder, nothing listening); every send threw, user still saw "check inbox". Now `MAIL_MAILER=log` + `MAIL_LOG_CHANNEL=mail` → dev-only `storage/logs/mail.log` (git-ignored), so links never land in laravel.log. Old tokens already in laravel.log (pre-session, default mailer) redacted.
- Login: email-only (`email` field, old `identifier` still accepted), errors under fields, email kept, rate-limit message with seconds, `?next=` (same-site only) + `?reason=` → explains why login is needed and returns afterwards; guest like/save/comment/follow links use it. Protected GET pages explain too.
- Register/reset: `x-form-field` + new `x-password-input`; confirmation error on the confirmation field (`same:password`); neutral reset message «إن كان البريد مسجّلًا لدينا فستصلك رسالة خلال دقائق».
- Inline Arabic validation for `form[data-validate]` (blur/input/submit, replaces browser bubbles), aria-describedby/invalid.
- Found while testing on 390px: logout + profile link were `display:none` on mobile; favorites/notifications had no link anywhere → new account menu (`site-header`) with profile, add quote, saved, notifications (+unread badge), edit profile, admin, logout. `scroll-padding-bottom` so the fixed bottom nav never covers focused fields/buttons.
- Tests: 5 new (wrong login, next/reason, unsafe next, protected page, reset flow). 47/47. Browser e2e on copied DB via log mailer: register inline errors, register, logout via menu, wrong password, neutral message ×2, one mail in mail.log (subject/sender/60 min/ignore/signature), invalid link, mismatch, reset, reused link rejected, login with new password, no token in laravel.log — all PASS (when runs are >1 min apart; rate limits otherwise trip, as intended).

## T2 Phase 5 — Profile redesign · DONE
- `PageController@profile`: tabs `quotes` / `liked` / `saved` (liked+saved owner-only; visitors fall back to quotes), real stats (quotes, likes received, followers, following; liked/saved counts on owner tabs), 9 per page with query string.
- `profile/show.blade.php` rebuilt: ivory cover band (no dark gradient block), avatar above the cover (no clipping), name/role/@handle/«عضو منذ أكتوبر 2026», actions (owner: add quote + edit; visitor: follow), stats row, tabs, shared `x-quote-card`, friendly empty states. Gender-neutral labels.
- Quote card: owner-only edit + delete (`@can`, server still enforces via policy). Delete returns to the page you were on (profile) or to the profile when deleted from the quote's own page.
- Shared `x-confirm-dialog` replaces all `confirm()` (5 forms).
- Profile edit: name 2–50 with hint, all fields via `x-form-field` (errors under each), inline validation. No password-change feature exists → not added.
- Tests: 2 new (tabs/privacy/stats/owner actions/403; delete from profile + name rules). 49/49. Screenshots: 1440 light/dark, 390, owner view — no overflow.

## T2 Phase 6 — UX consistency · DONE
- Old brand «أثر» removed from 4 views; one term for bookmarks everywhere: «المحفوظات» (menu, tab, page title, toasts, login reason); quote page save button shows its state.
- Forms: field labels/inputs always full width (label grid was shrinking to 219px on phones); inline validation on create/edit/composer/comment; duplicate top-of-page error hidden when field errors are shown.
- Toasts above the mobile bottom nav, high contrast, error variant (role=alert). Focus-visible outlines for links/buttons/summary/chips/pagination; search box focus ring.
- Bug found by e2e and fixed: the POST double-submit guard also caught `method="dialog"` forms, so after one «إلغاء» the confirm dialog's «نعم، احذف» did nothing.
- Browser audit (11 guest + 7 signed-in pages × 390/1440 + keyboard Tab walk): no overflow, no unnamed controls, no unlabeled inputs, no clipped text.
- Browser e2e regression (demo DB): create (inline error, counter, first on home, toast), edit, like/unlike via AJAX, save + المحفوظات page, search + clear, delete via dialog (cancel/confirm), 404 after delete, other user's edit → 403 — 18/18 PASS. PHP tests 49/49.
- Final numbers (warm, cache disabled): home TTFB 76–99ms / load 311–326ms (was 454/819); /quotes 56–67ms / 164–181ms (was 357/446). In-site nav 59–101ms, hover-then-click 13–29ms.
- Not refreshed: `deliverables/` (SRS PDF, zip) still reflect Task 1.

## T2 extra — Fountain pen + Gmail-ready email · DONE
- `components/fountain-pen.blade.php`: inline SVG vintage pen (ink barrel, copper nib/rings/clip), colours via CSS vars.
- Ink welcome: pen rides the copper stroke (same 1.75s delay/easing), lifts and fades by ~3s; only while `.is-animating` (once per session, never with reduced motion); absolutely positioned, transform/opacity only, pointer-events none.
- Measured (Edge headless, guest light + signed-in dark, 390/1440): pen tip within 1% of the drawn stroke at every sample; fades to 0 by 3.4s; CLS ≤ 0.0038; no overflow; no pen on 2nd visit; reduced motion: no pen, title fully visible.
- Static pen icon in the «＋ أضف اقتباسًا» buttons (quotes page, profile, home hero + empty state).
- Email: `.env` + `.env.example` set for Gmail SMTP (smtp.gmail.com:587) but `MAIL_MAILER=log` until MAIL_USERNAME/MAIL_PASSWORD are filled; sender falls back to the Gmail username (`config/mail.php`); `php artisan midad:mail-test <email>` checks the setup. `.env` backup at `.env.backup-before-gmail` (git-ignored). No real email sent.

# TASK 3 — Mobile, About page, deployment

## Mobile · DONE
- Browser audit (14 guest + 7 signed-in pages × 360/390): 72 touch targets <44px and 67 text styles <12px found → mobile layer in `app.css` (≤680px): 44px header/footer/menu controls, like/save/copy/share/edit/delete 44px, chips/pagination/search 44px, 16px inputs (no iOS zoom), 12px minimum small print, owner actions on their own row, natural text alignment in cards, header fits one line at 360px, shorter search placeholder. After: 0 overflow; remaining <44px only inline byline link (43px) and hidden file inputs (their labels are 44px); only <12px text is the decorative Latin «MIDAD» in the logo.

## About («عنّي») · DONE
- `pages/creator.blade.php` rebuilt: name meaning, what you can do (4 items with working links), owner + 4 links; removed dark hero and personal details (city, university, timeline). Links: GitHub 200, Instagram/X 200 (weak signal), LinkedIn blocks bots (999) — check manually.

## Deployment · DONE
- `SecureResponses` middleware (HTTPS 301 + headers), `FORCE_HTTPS` (false in local .env), `URL::forceScheme`, `.env.production.example`, `DEPLOY.md`, `tests/Feature/DeploymentTest.php` (5 tests). 54/54.
- Local production-mode run (config/routes/events/views cached to `storage/framework/prod-cache` so tests never read them): 301 http→https, 5 headers + HSTS, secure/httponly/lax cookies, 404 without debug, https links, CSRF 419, TTFB 21–31ms.
- Cloudflare quick tunnel (signed cloudflared 2026.10.3) → public https URL serving the real database; browser login check over https OK.
